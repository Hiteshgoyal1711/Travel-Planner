# Travel-Planner

This Computes the Minimum time to reach from a given starting location to a given destination, using plane(Red Edges) only once and can take bus(Yellow Edges) as many times as possible.


The RED Edges here denotes the time required to travel by plane and YELLOW Edges denotes the time required to travel by Bus.
As we click on the solve button, the algorithm computes the result and show the simplified graph.

Internally , The algorithm used here is dijkstra's Algorithm.
